# XFit: Exercise App

> ðŸ›ˆ _This app uses exercise data and images from the [everkinetic project][everkinetic]._

XFit is a web application that helps users to plan daily workout routines according to the availability of equipment they have at home. The application is intended to help users find and learn new exercises that they can perform at home in addition to organizing weekly routines that will contribute users to find a satisfying and consistent exercise pattern that works best for them.

## Some context

This app was made as final project for our Software Engineering Capstone class at Miami-Dade College, which we took as final requirement to complete the [BS-IST] program. The class required us to create the specification documents and implement our app based upon them, keeping everything updated as development progressed. In addition, we were required to submit a video showing the basic functionality of the app, as well as prepare a presentation for the last day of class.
